# ATLAS Code Camp: Day 1

## What is Processing
Processing is a software "sketchbook" designed for learning code with and emphasis on visual arts. It's built using the Java programming language, which means any of the concepts we learn with Processing will apply to Java as well. There are a plethora of books and tutorials on Processing. For those with no Processing experience, I recommend *[Getting Started with Processing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1457187086/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1457187086&linkCode=as2&tag=processing09-20&linkId=JEJC22CTQ5ZF4ZYO)*. If you want to tackel some more advanced topics, *[The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/)* is one of my favorite programming books ever, and it's free online!

## Getting Started
- Install Processing from [here](https://processing.org/download/)
- Then follow [this]() tutorial to learn the basics. *In class we went through this together*

## Processing Basics

### Coordinates
Throughout this course we will mostly be rendering in 2D, and coordinate system in Processing for 2D drawing uses X and Y. The Y axis is inverted in Processing 

### Drawing Shapes and Colors

### Order matters
Code is evaluated from left to right, then top to bottom. A good way to get familiar with this is to mess around the order of our draw code and see how it changes. Whatever you draw first will be at the back of your drawing, so it's important to consider the order of exectution when going for a specific effect.

### Make a Forrest!
The activity for today's class is to make a forrest using the draw code we learned before. Find a partner and together use the draw functions we learned to create a collection of trees.

### Variables and Types
If you look at the first bit of code we wrote `ellipse
