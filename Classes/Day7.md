# ATLAS Code Camp: Day 7

## Choose Your Own Project
Now that we've learned the basics, it's time for you to choose your first project on your own. This can be anything, just don't pick something too big since you only have till end of class Thursday. Here are some suggestions

- A data visualization that pulls from the web
- A simple audio visualizer
- A local multiplayer game with keyboard controls

Or whatever sounds fun to you!
