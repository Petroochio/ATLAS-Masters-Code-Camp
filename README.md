# ATLAS Code Camp
This is a three week summer program designed to get incoming CTD and ICTD master's students up to speed on the basics of programming before the semester begins. In this camp we will cover the basics of programming including: variables, types, functions, loops, objects... and whatever else we have time for.

The first two weeks will have specific knowledge goals, while the last week will be designed to fit the interests of the group of students.

## What you will need
- a laptop computer
- a can do attitude
That's it!

## Classes
This section will be updated with links to an outline of each class as I finalize them. I will also add each set of lecture slides [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wGQJuUNkABrol8sglzwxxfkUlXbFwmMQ?usp=sharing) as we go through them. *You must have a CU Boulder email account to access the slides.*
